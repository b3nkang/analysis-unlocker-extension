# Analysis Unlocker - for Chess.com

Download all files in the repo and store them in a folder.

Type the following into your Chrome search bar: chrome://extensions/

This will open you on the site with all of your installed Chrome extensions.

Now, on the site, go to the top right corner and toggle "developer mode" on. Then, in the top left hand side of the banner, under the big "Extensions" text, there should be a "load unpacked" button. Press it, and upload the folder with the extension. 

Pin the extension to your Extensions bar if you want - it will automatically adjust your Chess.com UI to include an "unlock analysis" button.

# How to unlock analysis:
Press the "unlock analysis" button to ONE game and only press it ONCE, or else you may overload the server. The backend server will take 10-20 seconds to unlock your analysis. In the meantime, you can navigate away from the page, or do whatever you like. After around 20-30 seconds (depending on your internet speed), refresh your page, and click into the analysis of the game whose button you had pressed. 

The review should be unlocked. If in your profile page your game has accuracy percentages, it means the game has been unlocked. If not, click into the game and see. If it still is locked, wait 30 more seconds before trying again.
